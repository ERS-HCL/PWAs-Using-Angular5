Creating PWAs using Angular 5

This is a sample app for building an PWA using Angular 5.

What is PWA  ?

A progressive web app (PWA) delivers an app-like experience through your mobile phoneâ€™s browser but has the same flexibility and gestures as a native application. Because they are powered by mobile browsers, they are not particular to any one device, meaning developers no longer need to write separate code for Android and Apple devices.
